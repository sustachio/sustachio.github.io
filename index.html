          wire fence, but was later rebuilt with concrete blocks that were 12 feet high and four feet wide.</div>

        <div class="top">Why was it built?</div>
        <div class="main">Before the Berlin Wall was built, around 2.5 million East Germans had fled to West Germany. This was not good for the Soviet Union, 
          because they were losing a lot of workers. <br><br> In response to all of the people leaving they built the Berlin wall. The wall was very hard to pass 
          because it was guarded by a lot of soldiers. The wall made sure that barley anyone could escape Soviet-controlled East Berlin.
